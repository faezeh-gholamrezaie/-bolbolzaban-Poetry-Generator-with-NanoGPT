# bolbolzaban-Poetry-Generator-with-NanoGPT

This repository features a sophisticated Persian poetry generator model built using the NanoGPT architecture. Leveraging data and tokenization techniques from the bolbolzaban, this model is finely tuned to create elegant and contextually rich Persian poetry. By combining the robustness of the bolbolzaban resources with the lightweight yet powerful capabilities of NanoGPT, this project aims to provide a unique tool for generating high-quality Persian verse.
